    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! 🌿🔍

    Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    #### About the Dataset

    This dataset has been augmented offline from the original dataset to increase its size and variability. The original dataset can be found on the [New Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) page on Kaggle. This augmented dataset consists of approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different classes. 

    The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation:
    - **Training set:** 70,295 images
    - **Validation set:** 17,572 images
    - **Test set:** 33 images

    The training and validation sets are divided in an 80/20 ratio while preserving the original directory structure. A separate test directory with 33 images has been created specifically for prediction purposes.

    #### Dataset Structure

    1. **train**: Contains 70,295 images used for training the deep learning model.
    2. **valid**: Contains 17,572 images used for validating the model during training.
    3. **test**: Contains 33 images used for testing the model's predictions.

    This dataset is a valuable resource for training and evaluating models for plant disease detection, providing a diverse set of images to ensure robust model performance.
