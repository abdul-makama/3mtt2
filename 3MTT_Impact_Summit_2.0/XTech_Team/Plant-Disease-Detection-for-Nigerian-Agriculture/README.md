# Plant Disease Detection

This project utilizes deep learning to detect plant diseases from images of plant leaves. It includes Jupyter notebooks for training and testing the model, as well as a Streamlit web interface where users can upload images to get predictions.

## Files
- `main.py`: Streamlit app for plant disease detection.
- `test_plant_disease.ipynb`: Notebook for testing the model.
- `train_plant_disease.ipynb`: Notebook for training the model.
- `trained_plant_disease_model.keras`: The trained Keras model.
- `training_hist.json`: Training history.
- `home_page.jpeg`: Image for the home page.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
    - Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Jacobjayk/Plant_Disease_Detection.git
    cd Plant_Disease_Detection
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    - Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**
    - Download the [New Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) from kaggle and extract it and copy the folders 'test', 'train', and 'valid' into the project directory.

4. **Data Preparation and Model Training**
    - Run the `train_plant_disease.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to train the model and save the trained model:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook train_plant_disease.ipynb
    ```

5. **Testing the Model**
    - After training, you can test the model using the `test_plant_disease.ipynb` notebook to evaluate its performance:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook test_plant_disease.ipynb
    ```

6. **Run the Streamlit App**
    - Start the Streamlit app to use the web interface for plant disease detection:
    ```sh
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model:** Follow the instructions in the `train_plant_disease.ipynb` notebook to train the model with your dataset.

2. **Test the Model:** Use the `test_plant_disease.ipynb` notebook to test the trained model and evaluate its performance.

3. **Run the Web App:** Start the Streamlit app using the command above and upload images of plant leaves to get disease predictions.

## Notes

- Ensure you have all dependencies installed as listed in `requirements.txt`.
- The [New Plant Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) must be organized correctly for the data preparation and training notebooks to function properly.
- The trained model is saved as `trained_plant_disease_model.keras` and can be loaded by the Streamlit app for making predictions.
